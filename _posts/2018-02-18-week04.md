### Fixing the Course Website

I was working on issue number 6, fixing a broken link to the version control slides. To solve this issue, I first forked the repository (by clicking on the fork button on the website). 
After forking the repository, I then cloned it to my computer using the following command: 


`git clone git@github.com:dazigemm/cs480_s18.git`

When the repository was successfully cloned, I switched into that directory and created a new branch called fix-vc-slides-link to work in through the following commands:


`git branch fix-vc-slides-link`

`git checkout fix-vc-slides-link`

The broken link to the version control slides was found in the markdown page for class 5, which can be found here [here](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/blob/gh-pages/_includes/daily/05.markdown).
After fixing the link, I used the commands below to commit my changes and push them.


`git add 05.markdown`

`git commit -m "removed md extension on vc slides' link"`

`git push --set-upstream origin fix-vc-slides-link`

After my changes were pushed, I went to GitHub and clicked the "New pull request" button next to my branch. 

The pull request I submitted can be viewed [here](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/67).

### Code Triage

I didn't spend as thorough of a time looking through the projects on Code Triage as I should have. Instead, I just clicked on the first thing that I recognized, which was React, and signed up for one issue a day.

The very first issue I received from them was actually a few years old, initially posted in
