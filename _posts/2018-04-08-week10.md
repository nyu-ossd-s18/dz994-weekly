### Open Source at Google

I think it's wonderful that Google is getting involved in open source. However, the approach also shows how there's a legal side that can complicate things. For example, the separation between internal teams who are at times unable to reveal why certain pull requests cannot be accepted, or what tests they failed. It does seem thought that most teams try their best not to let this barrier though. 

### Codes of Conducts

I think a code of conduct is a good idea. By having what is expected from the community in writing, it makes things easier should a situatiion arise where someone needs to be called out for inappropriate behavior. I am not aware of what the community is like in other projects. However, I think it's always a nice thing to have.  

Phaser also has a [code of conduct](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
