### Phaser Progress

For this week we have been working on the powerpoint for this week's presentations and our individual slides. 

### Phaser License

The license that Phaser currently uses is the MIT license. With this license, users are allowed to modify and distribute, even for commercial use. However, the creators of Phaser cannot be held responsible for any consequences that may arise.
