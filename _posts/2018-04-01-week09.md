### Questions For Danna

* How often do you work on projects outside of class now?
* What was your first encounter with open source like? 
* How does working on an open source team differ from other teams? Which do you prefer?

### Phaser Progress Report

As of last week, the group has decided to approach Phaser in two ways. Half of the team will tackle fixing the issues in the Phaser 3 examples. As they are just transitioning over to the new version, a lot of the examples are broken. This is what I am working on. I am currently looking into how to get the Cannon game example running. It seems as if it uses methods that are either outdated or not yet released. 
The other half of the team is working on creating well documented a Phaser 3 example.
